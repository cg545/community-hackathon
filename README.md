# Buffalo prep LLM

Buffalo Prep was founded in 1989 by education and community leaders to help talented underrepresented students prepare for, obtain entrance into, and excel at demanding college preparatory high schools. Buffalo Prep has grown exponentially over the years and now serves hundreds of students and alumni each year with our unique pipeline of Prep Scholars Academy, Middle School Prep, High School Prep, College Prep, and Alumni Prep programs. Many students begin Buffalo Prepâ€™s rigorous program in 5th grade and commit their summers, evenings, and weekends to prepare for higher achievement.
